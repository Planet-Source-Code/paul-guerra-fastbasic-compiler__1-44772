The 'GetEvent' instruction retrives the event that made the module execute. The possible values are:

-1		Call*
0		Click
1		MouseDown
2		MouseUp
3		Change
4		KeyPress
5		DblClick

* The module was called by the code, i.e. a function call or similar.


MESSAGE:

This is pretty much like 'Msgbox' in Visual Basic. Works like this:

Message <text> <type> <title>

<text>: string-type expression. It is the text you want to show.
<type>: must be one of these:

nrm: no icon is shown
inf: information icon is shown
qst: question icon is shown
exc: exclamation icon is shown
cri: critical icon is shown

<title>: string-type expression. Title of the window.

You cannot either specify the buttons that will appear (always OK) or retrieve which button was pressed (since it's always OK).
